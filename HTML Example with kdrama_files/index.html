    <p id="first-paragraph">Perhaps it's because it offers a slice-of-life eating experience you 
        can't get with more traditional dining options, or maybe it's the adventure
         of having no idea what new taste sensations you'll be experiencing that day.</p>
         <p >
          Whatever the reason, one thing is sure – street food is fun, fast, 
          and one-of-a-kind delicious!</p>
          
           <p id="second">The Starry Night is an oil-on-canvas painting by the Dutch Post-Impressionist 
            painter Vincent van Gogh, painted in June 1889. It depicts the view from the
             east-facing window of his asylum room at Saint-Rémy-de-Provence, 
            just before sunrise, with the addition of an imaginary village.</p>
